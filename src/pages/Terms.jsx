        <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
          By purchasing and accepting delivery of any products supplied by
          PeptideStream (&quot;Products&quot;) you agree to be bound by these
          Terms and Conditions. Any other terms or conditions contained in any
          order form or other document submitted by you which are inconsistent
          with, or in addition to, these Terms and Conditions are rejected,
          objected to and shall be deemed void and of no force or effect.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>
          Once submitted, any change(s) to your order(s) may be made only with
          advance written approval of PeptideStream, and such changes may require
          different terms, including a change in price and/or delivery time.
          Orders may not be cancelled unless PeptideStream expressly approves in
          writing, which may be contingent upon your payment of all associated
          costs, including but not limited to storage, non-standard materials,
          non-returnable materials, supplier charges, and other expenses. A
          verified bill of costs issued by PeptideStream shall be conclusive.
          PeptideStream reserves the right to cancel any order upon your breach
          of these Terms, or in the event of your bankruptcy, insolvency,
          dissolution, receivership, or any circumstance that reasonably calls
          into question your ability or willingness to pay.
        </p>

        <h2>Delivery &amp; Claims</h2>
        <p>
          Delivery of Products to the carrier at PeptideStream’s shipping point
          constitutes delivery to you, and you bear all risk of loss or damage
          in transit. PeptideStream reserves the right to determine the method
          of shipment and to make delivery in installments, each separately
          invoiced. Delay in one installment does not relieve you of the
          obligation to accept the others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Immediately upon receipt, you must inspect the Products and notify
          PeptideStream in writing of any shortages, defects, or damage, and
          hold the Products pending instructions. You have fourteen (14) days
          from receipt to report issues; inquiries after that window are not
          valid. If you fail to notify PeptideStream within one (1) day of
          receipt, the Products are deemed conforming and irrevocably accepted.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you choose to opt out of the automatically calculated and included
          shipping insurance protection program, and your package is lost or
          damaged by the carrier, you will not receive a replacement shipment.
          PeptideStream strongly recommends that you do not opt out of shipping
          insurance. By placing an order without shipping insurance, you agree
          that shipment, non-delivery, missing package, and damage claims are
          null and void and that you are solely responsible for any such issues.
        </p>

        <h2>Waiver of Liability for Delivery</h2>
        <p>
          PROOF OF DISPATCH OF THE MERCHANDISE WILL BIND THE CARDHOLDER.
          MERCHANT OFFERS CARDHOLDER THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE SHIPPING
          INSURANCE PROTECTION WHICH SHALL BE CARDHOLDER’S SOLE REMEDY IN THE
          EVENT MERCHANDISE IS DISPATCHED BY MERCHANT BUT NOT RECEIVED BY
          CARDHOLDER.
        </p>

        <h2>Delays &amp; Force Majeure</h2>
        <p>
          Any specified delivery dates are estimates only and do not constitute
          a promise. PeptideStream shall not be liable for any loss, damage or
          penalty resulting from delay or failure to perform due to causes
          beyond its reasonable control (&quot;Force Majeure Events&quot;),
          including but not limited to acts of God, fire, explosion, accident,
          vandalism, theft, war, terrorism, riots, labor disputes, pandemics,
          epidemics, embargoes, governmental actions, supply chain disruptions,
          carrier delays, or inability to obtain materials, power, or labor at
          reasonable cost.
        </p>

        <h2>Allocation of Products</h2>
        <p>
          If PeptideStream is unable to supply the total demand for Products
          specified in your order, PeptideStream may allocate its available
          supply among customers (including distributors) as it deems fair and
          practical, without liability.
        </p>

        <h2>Payment, Interest &amp; Chargebacks</h2>
        <p>
          In the event of default in payment or other breach, PeptideStream may,
          without prejudice to other remedies, defer delivery, cancel your
          orders, and/or sell undelivered Products for your account and apply
          proceeds against the purchase price. You agree to pay any remaining
          balance on demand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any unapproved chargebacks will result in your information being
          reported to collections. Interest of 0.83% per month (or the maximum
          rate permitted by law, if lower) is charged on unpaid balances not
          paid in full within ten (10) days of invoice.
        </p>

        <h3>US Bank Account Payment Method (ACH)</h3>
        <p>
          ACH payments may involve a credit (&quot;push&quot;) or debit
          (&quot;pull&quot;) and are typically processed in batches over 3–4
          business days. By authorizing ACH, you consent to these transfers and
          timing as determined by the ACH network and participating financial
          institutions.
        </p>

        <h2>Taxes &amp; Other Charges</h2>
        <p>
          Except for any sales tax collected and invoiced by PeptideStream, you
          are responsible for all taxes, duties, fees, or charges imposed by any
          authority in connection with the transaction. If PeptideStream is
          required to pay any such amounts, you shall reimburse PeptideStream or
          provide a valid exemption certificate.
        </p>

        <h2>Pricing &amp; Price Changes</h2>
        <p>
          Quotations are firm only if you place a corresponding order within the
          stated validity period or, if none, within thirty (30) days. If, prior
          to delivery, PeptideStream’s material costs increase by 10% or more,
          PeptideStream may cancel undelivered orders or condition performance
          on your acceptance of a corresponding price increase.
        </p>

        <h2>Warranties &amp; Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          PeptideStream warrants that Products, at the time of shipment, conform
          to the description in its product literature or analytical data.
          THIS WARRANTY IS EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES,
          EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
        </p>
        <p>
          Warranties are void if Products are misused, handled contrary to
          industry standards, used outside provided instructions, or used in any
          prohibited manner. IN NO EVENT SHALL PEPTIDESTREAM BE LIABLE FOR ANY
          INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING
          LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR PERSONAL
          INJURY. LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE CONTRACT PRICE OF THE PRODUCTS
          GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.
        </p>

        <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
        <p>
          Failure by PeptideStream to enforce any provision shall not be deemed

          convenience only. These Terms bind and benefit the parties and their
          permitted successors and assigns.
