Once submitted, you may not cancel any order unless cancellation is expressly approved by PeptideStream in writing, which approval may be contingent on your payment of PeptideStream’s costs or other charges, including, but not limited to, storage and shipment costs, costs of producing non-standard materials, costs of purchasing non-returnable materials, cancellation costs imposed on PeptideStream by its suppliers, and any other costs resulting from cancellation. A verified bill of costs issued by an officer or other authorized representative of PeptideStream shall be conclusive as to the amount of such costs. PeptideStream reserves the right to cancel any order, in whole or in part, upon your breach of these terms and conditions or your bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution, receivership proceedings, or upon the occurrence of any event leading PeptideStream to reasonably question your willingness or ability to pay.</p>

        <p><strong>Waiver of Liability For Delivery</strong></p>
        <p>WAIVER OF LIABILITY FOR DELIVERY: PROOF OF DISPATCH OF THE MERCHANDISE WILL BIND THE CARDHOLDER. MERCHANT OFFERS CARDHOLDER THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE SHIPPING INSURANCE PROTECTION WHICH SHALL BE CARDHOLDER’S SOLE REMEDY IN THE EVENT MERCHANDISE IS DISPATCHED BY MERCHANT BUT NOT RECEIVED BY CARDHOLDER.</p>

        <p><strong>Delays</strong></p>
        <p>Any specified delivery dates are estimates only and do not represent a promise by PeptideStream to deliver Products at a date certain. PeptideStream shall not be liable for any loss, damage or penalty as a result of any delay in or failure to manufacture, deliver or otherwise perform hereunder due to any cause beyond PeptideStream’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, unsuccessful reactions, act(s) of you, embargo or other governmental act, regulation or request affecting the conduct of PeptideStream’s business, fire, explosion, accident, theft, vandalism, riot, acts of war, strikes or other labor difficulties, lightning, flood, windstorm or other acts of God, delay in transportation, or inability to obtain necessary labor, fuel, materials, supplies or power at current prices.</p>

        <p><strong>Allocation of Products</strong></p>
        <p>If PeptideStream is unable for any reason to supply the total demands for Products specified in your order, PeptideStream may allocate its viable supply among any or all customers (including PeptideStream’s distributors) on such basis as PeptideStream may deem fair and practical, without liability for any failure of performance which may result therefrom.</p>

        <p><strong>Payment and Interest</strong></p>
        <p>In the event of default by you in the payment of the purchase price or otherwise, PeptideStream, at its option, without prejudice to any other of PeptideStream’s lawful remedies, may defer delivery, cancel your order and any other order of you, or sell any undelivered products on hand for the account of you and apply such proceeds as a credit, without set-off or deduction of any kind, against the agreed upon purchase price, and you agree to pay the balance then due to PeptideStream on demand. For any chargebacks done by the customer, and not approved by PeptideStream, will result in the customer’s information being reported to collections.</p>

        <p>An interest charge of 0.83% per month (or the maximum rate permitted by law if less than 0.83% per month) is charged on any unpaid balance. Interest charges accrue if the invoiced amount is not paid in full within 10 days of the invoice date.</p>

        <p><strong>US Bank Account Payment Method</strong></p>
        <p>ACH (Automated Clearing House) payment processing facilitates electronic transfers between bank accounts, involving a “push” (credit) or “pull” (debit) of funds, typically processed in batches over 3-4 business days (excluding weekends and holidays).</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Initiation:</strong> The customer authorizes an ACH debit of their account.</li>
          <li><strong>Batching:</strong> The ACH processor collects multiple ACH requests and groups them into batches. These batches are then sent to an ACH operator, which can be either the Federal Reserve or The Clearing House.</li>
          <li><strong>Processing:</strong> The ACH operator processes the batches and routes them to the bank holding the recipient’s account, called the Receiving Depository Financial Institution (RDFI). The RDFI then debits or credits the recipient’s account depending on the type of ACH transaction initiated.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Taxes and other charges</strong></p>
        <p>PeptideStream shall not be responsible for the payment of any use tax, sales tax, excise tax, duty, custom, inspection or testing fee, or any other tax, fee or charge of any nature whatsoever imposed by any governmental authority, on or measured by the transaction between, with the sole exception of any sales taxes invoiced and collected from you by PeptideStream. All other such charges (if any) must be paid by you separately and in addition to the prices quoted or invoiced. In the event PeptideStream is required to pay any such tax, fee or charge, you shall reimburse PeptideStream therefore; or, in lieu of such payment, you shall provide PeptideStream at the time the order is submitted an exemption certificate or other document acceptable to the authority imposing the tax, fee or charge.</p>

        <p><strong>Price Changes</strong></p>
        <p>Shipment will be made promptly even if prices have been nominally increased. Notwithstanding any price quotation or prices listed by PeptideStream, if at any time prior to delivery PeptideStream’s costs of materials have increased by 10% or more, then PeptideStream may cancel any accepted but undelivered orders or condition the continuance of any order on your agreement to a corresponding increase in price.</p>
